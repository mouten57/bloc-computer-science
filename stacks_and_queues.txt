>1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

The main difference between a stack and queue is that a stack implements a LIFO priority collection, while a queue implements a FIFO priority collection. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

>2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?
- They both are used to store data
- They enable engineers to rank tasks
- Allow an order of operations
- Support system functions


3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

- UNDO/REDO: For implementing the undo/redo function, I'd probably use LIFO, or a stack, because I'd want to look at the most recent arrival first. For undo, I'd pop off the most recent item and push it onto a redo stack; for re-do, I'd pop off the most recent item from the redo stack and push it back on the main (undo) stack.

/////////PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS//////////
1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

function REVERSE(original) {
  let stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < original.length; i++)
    stack.push(original[i]);
  
  let reversed = '';
  for (let i = stack.length-1; i >= 0; i--)
    reversed += stack[i];
  return reversed;
}


2. Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

-To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.

CLASS Stack
FUNCTION pop(queue) {
   let list = [];
   for (let i = 0; i < queue.length-1; i++)
    list.push(queue[i]);
  let deleted = queue[queue.length-1]
  return deleted
}
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS


3. Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).

CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
   APPEND element to the end of the list
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
   SET temp to the first element
  REMOVE FIRST element of list from list
  RETURN temp
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
