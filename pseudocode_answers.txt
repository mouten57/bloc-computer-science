>Why do programmers use pseudocode?
-Programmers use pseudocode to plan out, in human language, what their program will do. It's an informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms.
If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
-It would not work!

Programming Assignment
//////////////////////
**Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:**

>Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number
    PRINT first number
ELSE
    PRINT second number

>Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
SET number to 1
FOR number less than or equal to 100
    PRINT number
    ADD 1 to number

>Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
INPUT searchTerm
IF phonebook has at least one entry
     IF phonebook contains searchTerm
        PUSH data to SEARCH RESULTS
     RETURN SEARCHRESULTS
ELSE   
    PRINT 'There are no results'

>Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
(Search is based on first name)

const phonebook = [
  {firstname: "Matt",
  lastname: "Outen",
  number: 8675309},
]

const search = (searchTerm) => {
    let searchResults = [];
    if (phonebook.length < 1){console.log('There are no entries.')}
    for(let i=0; i<phonebook.length; i++){
        if (phonebook[i].firstname == searchTerm){
            searchResults.push(phonebook[i]);
          return searchResults;
        }
        return('There are no results.')
    }
}
